## :crystal_ball: A small person who likes to write some Code stuff

:pushpin: Hi there! I working in the field of servicing Windows and Linux user systems and servers for the past three years. I work with hypervisors such as Proxmox, set up switches and routers in networks of varying complexities, and implemented various solutions for server hardware and systems, including reverse proxies.

:books: As a system administrator, I write various scripts that automate some actions or simply perform interesting tasks. I have experience with Python, Batch, Bash, PowerShell, and JavaScript (node.js).

:orange_heart: The developer of Discord-Bot that helps with timestamps, randomize date and integers, check current time in different timezones and other cool things called [Timestamp 補佐](https://github.com/SHULKERPLAY/Timestamp-Hosa)! 11 Languages supported - [App Directory page](https://discord.com/discovery/applications/1449839745910964254)

:blue_heart: Recently, I created a tool for the Russian-speaking community that allows users to learn about newly blocked Internet resources in Russia, - [Zapretyan](https://github.com/SHULKERPLAY/Zapretyan). Additionally, I developed a version of this tool using a WebHook, called [Zapretyan Lite](https://github.com/SHULKERPLAY/Zapretyan-Lite). This is a pre-built solution for creating a Discord bot, as well as a pre-configured setup for using the tool through a WebHook without the need to create a bot.


 :gear: Previously, I worked on a [tool](https://github.com/Lunar-Creators/FFpepeg) that allowed to quickly run various video processing tasks using FFmpeg, without needing to know the command line flags for Windows systems. While I have not yet completed this project, there were plans to create a user-friendly interface for the tool. However, this would require a complete rewrite of the code, and this project has been temporarily put on hold.
